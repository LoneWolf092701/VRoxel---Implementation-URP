# Infinite Terrain Generator
A procedural terrain generation system for Unity using Wave Function Collapse (WFC) with advanced features for creating seamless, infinite worlds.

# Overview
This project implements a sophisticated procedural terrain generation system that creates realistic, varied landscapes that can extend infinitely. It combines the Wave Function Collapse algorithm with hierarchical constraints, marching cubes mesh generation, and efficient chunk management to create high-quality terrain that performs well even on modest hardware.

# Key Features
<br>*Infinite terrain generation with dynamic loading/unloading based on player position*
<br>*Seamless chunk transitions through an advanced boundary management system*
<br>*Hierarchical constraint system for controlling terrain features at multiple scales*
<br>*Parallel processing for improved performance*
<br>*Level of Detail (LOD) system for distant terrain*
<br>*Marching Cubes algorithm for smooth terrain mesh generation*
<br>*Extensible terrain types with the Mountain Valley terrain included*
<br>*Highly configurable through scriptable objects and the Unity editor*

# Architecture
The system is organized into several subsystems that work together:
# Core WFC Algorithm
The Wave Function Collapse algorithm is implemented with a focus on 3D terrain generation. Key components include:

<br>Cell.cs: Fundamental unit that can be in multiple possible states until "collapsed"
<br>Chunk.cs: 3D grid of cells that forms a terrain section
<br>WFCGenerator.cs: Main implementation of the WFC algorithm

# Constraint System
A multi-scale constraint system provides control over terrain features:

<br>GlobalConstraint.cs: Large-scale features like mountain ranges and biomes
<br>RegionConstraint.cs: Medium-scale features like forests and lakes
<br>HierarchicalConstraintSystem.cs: Manages constraints across different scales

# Chunk Management
For infinite worlds, the system dynamically loads and unloads chunks:

<br>ChunkManager.cs: Handles chunk lifecycle based on player position
<br>BoundaryBufferManager.cs: Ensures seamless transitions between chunks

# Mesh Generation
Terrain visualization uses the Marching Cubes algorithm for smooth meshes:

<br>MeshGenerator.cs: Converts WFC cells to Unity meshes
<br>MarchingCubesGenerator.cs: Implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm
<br>DensityFieldGenerator.cs: Creates density fields for Marching Cubes

# Performance Optimization
Multiple techniques ensure good performance:

<br>ParallelWFCProcessor.cs: Distributes WFC computation across multiple threads
<br>Memory optimization for distant chunks
<br>LOD system for reducing detail in far-away terrain

# Configuration System
The entire system is highly configurable:

<br>WFCConfiguration.cs: Scriptable object with all system parameters
<br>WFCConfigManager.cs: Singleton for accessing configuration
Custom editor for easy configuration in Unity
